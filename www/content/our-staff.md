### Senior Pastor
## Christopher Chern

{{< img src="/images/profile-cccl.jpg" title="Senior Pastor Christopher Chern" class="image fit">}}

Born in Singapore and raised in Taoism, I was very religious and joined my parents in their beliefs. I would visit the temple, ask for blessings from those gods, and wear amulets and idols for protection. In 1974, I was saved through the witness of a schoolmate who brought me to a Bible study when I was in Secondary 1.

After I had made the commitment to accept Christ, my life began to change, just as the bible says

> “Therefore, if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature, old things are passed away; behold all things are become new.” - 2 Cor 5: 17

Subsequently, I started to put away my past practices of praying to idols, as I was assured of my salvation based on 1 John 5: 12-13 and John 1: 12.

When I was 18, I was felt God’s calling to full-time service during an evangelistic meeting. On 23rd May 1986, I married my sweetheart, Diana Cheong. We had been working together at Hong Kong Bank. In 1994, I was able to transit into full-time ministry work and have been pastoring the congregation at GBM since 1994. I graduated from International Baptist College (IBC) in Tempe, Arizona (USA) with a M.A. in Biblical Studies and was ordained in 1997. In 2012, I received my honorary doctorate of divinity (D.D.) from South India Baptist Bible College & Seminary.

My wife is currently a home-maker and an excellent cook at that! She is my perfect helpmeet whom God has provided for me as we serve together in GBM. We have two daughters: Charissa, and Cheryl. I enjoy playing racket games and jogging with my wife. My prayer is that God would fill me with a zeal for His glory and enable me to effectively proclaim God’s Word. Also, I pray that He would make me a servant-leader as I shepherd this flock preach the gospel to the lost and grace to the saved.

### Communications Pastor

As a child, I attended a Methodist church where my mother faithfully brought me to every week. When I was 8 or 9 years old, I remember attending a Children’s Camp and a lesson on the Lord’s Supper. The teacher took me and the rest of the kids into the sanctuary and explained the Lord’s Supper to us while showing us the elements. I vividly recall being able to imagine the crushing of Christ’s bones and the blood flowing from His body as He died on the cross. It was there that I understood the gospel and made the decision to accept Christ as my Saviour.

My mother reminded me of a time when I told her that I would serve God. I believe that God had gradually prepared me for the ministry through the many different experiences and people in my life. One of the things that I have greatly enjoyed is serving in the Children’s Ministry - teaching, playing the guitar, playing games, etc.

I graduated with my B.A. from NUS (Information Communications Management) and subsequently worked in media sales. After 2-3 years, I heeded the advice of godly men and decided to study the Masters of Ministry (M.Min) degree at International Baptist College (IBC) for 1 ½ years. As I spent time in formal biblical education and discipleship with the different professors and pastors at both Tri-City Baptist Church (TBC) and IBC, I gradually felt the call to full-time ministry. I could do nothing else but give my life to whatever ministry God had for me. Close to finishing my M.Min, I serve in Grace Baptist Ministries (GBM) as the Communications Pastor.

God has blessed me with a helpmeet and best friend in my wife, Dency. We have a son, Zhe Jing, that is a constant reminder that we need to pursue godly wisdom and seek God in whatever we set out to do! My family is a constant source of blessing and support as I serve!

It has been a journey in which I see the hand of God moving in my family. I thank God for what He has done and look forward to what He has planned for us!
