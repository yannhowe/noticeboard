### A Brief History

Grace Baptist Ministries (GBM) is founded from a merger of two church bodies. The first group, Open Bible Baptist Church (OBBC), was founded on 25 Mar 1994 under the pastoral leadership of Pastor Pat Delaney. From its humble beginnings in the home of Pastor Pat with just 2 others in 1989, the Lord brought 10 others by the time of its founding. The church continued to grow through the years. Pastor Pat has since moved on to become the Field Administrator of Baptist World Mission based out of USA.

While OBBC was looking for a senior pastor to lead their congregation, a larger group of believers from Baptist Fellowship Church (BFC) also happened to be at a major junction in seeking for further opportunities to expand their ministry. After a series of discussions in Jul 2010, both groups concluded that a merging of congregations would be mutually beneficial. It was the start of a new beginning for both groups.

As of 1 Dec 2010, this new body is officially known as Grace Baptist Ministries. We, as a new body of believers started worshipping and ministering together on 1 Aug 2010 at City College Singapore while waiting for the purchase and renovation of our church building at Ace Building in Macpherson. As of end Nov 2011, we have moved into a more permanent location at Macpherson to embark on its mission to fulfil the Great Commission in Singapore, South East Asia and the rest of the world. We are by conviction an independent, self-governing Baptist Church whose leaders are elected by its membership

### Our Vision

Glorifying God by building and developing a church of genuine Christians to fulfill the Great Commission.

### Our Mission

Glorify God in Worship
Rely on the Holy Spirit
Advance the Gospel
Care for the Body
Equip God’s disciples

### Our Values

We believe that the Bible is God’s Word to His people and is the only foundation for our faith and practice.
We believe that worship is the duty of all man.
We believe that a church is built on strong families and marriages. We strive to excellence in our youth and children’s programs.
We believe that evangelism is a natural response to God’s love.
Every Christian is a minister of Christ with spiritual gifts for service.

### A Summary of our Beliefs

We believe the "Bible" is the inspired Word of God and that it is inerrant and infallible and is the supreme and final authority for faith and practice.

We believe in the triune nature of God, that there is but one God existing in three persons: Father, Son and Holy Spirit, who are Co-eternal, Co-eval and Co-equal.

We believe in the absolute Deity of Jesus Christ, His incarnation, His virgin birth, His sinless life and miraculous ministry on earth, His death on the cross as a substitutionary atonement for the sins of all men, His bodily resurrection, His exaltation, His personal, premillennial, pre-tribulational, and imminent return.

We believe that Adam was created in innocence, by a voluntary transgression fell and that when Adam fell, mankind fell. We believe that man is born with a sinful nature and is spiritually dead, that he is totally depraved and unable to effect his own salvation.

We believe that Salvation is by grace through faith in the finished work of Christ. By which work, Christ fully satisfied the just demands of a Holy and righteous God.

We believe that there are two ordinances of the Local Church: Baptism and the Lord's Supper. Baptism is by immersion for believers, the Lord's Supper is a commemoration of His death, burial and resurrection and is to be observed until He comes again.

We believe in the Biblical Doctrine of Separation. In order to maintain unity and purity, it is necessary to separate from those who deny the fundamentals of the faith and to live holy and separated lives.
