### What is it?
Connect groups are small groups of 6-12 people who gather on a regular basis, usually at someone's home.

### Who is it for?
Connect groups are made of church members, regulars and people who are interested to find out more about the christian faith.

### Can I visit a few different groups before deciding on one?
Yes, we understand that you may want to visit more than one group before deciding on the best one for you. We do recommend that you visit a group more than once before making a decision.

### Can I be a regular group member of more than one group at a time?
Yes, you are welcome to be member of more than one group, but generally speaking it is often difficult to participate fully in the life of more than one group at a time.

### How can I find a group with people similar to me in age/work?
We do not have CGs for any specific group or demographic. More often than not they choose to be together due to location or life-stage.

### How can I start my own group?
If you are already a member of a CG, talk to your group leader about your interest in co-leading your group or in starting a new group. If you are interested in starting a new group, please contact one of our pastors or staff.

### If I haven't heard back from a group that I contacted, what should I do?
Please contact office@gbm.sg. While our leaders do their best to contact you in a timely manner, things happen. If you have not heard back after a week, we will be happy to help contact the leader for you.
