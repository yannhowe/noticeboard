*This is the scriptural basis for our belief. To read about our philosophy of ministry instead, go [here](/philosophy-of-ministry/)*

### 1. The Holy Bible

We believe that the Holy Bible was written by men supernaturally inspired by God; that it has truth without any admixture of error for its matter; and therefore is, and shall remain to the end of age, the only complete and final revelation of the will of God to man; the true centre of Christian union, and the supreme standard by which all human conduct, creeds and opinions should be tried. By “The Holy Bible”, we mean that collection of sixty-six books from Genesis to Revelation, which, as originally written, does not only contain and convey the Word of God, but is the very Word of God. By “inspiration”, we mean that the Books of the Bible were written by holy men of old, as they were moved by the Holy Spirit, in such a definite way that their writings were supernaturally and verbally inspired and free from error as no other writings.

> II Timothy 3:16-17: “All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness; that the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furnished unto all good works. ”

<!-- -->

> II Peter 1:20-21: “Knowing this first, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation. For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost. ”

### 2. The True God

#### 2.1 The Trinity

We believe in the Triune nature of God; that there is but one God existing in three persons. Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. Who are co-eternal, co-eval and coequal.

> Psalm 83:18: “That men may know that thou, whose name alone is JEHOVAH, art the most high over all the earth. ”I John 5:7: “For there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost: and these three are one. ”

<!-- -->

> Ephesians 4:6: “One God and Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in you all. ”

<!-- -->

> John 11:25: “Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live. ”

<!-- -->

> John 10:36: “Say ye of him, whom the Father hath sanctified and sent into the world, Thou blasphemest; because I said, I am the Son of God?”

<!-- -->

> I Thessalonians. 5:9: “For God hath not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ. ”

#### 2.2.The Father

We believe that God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, is the Heavenly Father of all who have come to a saving knowledge of His only begotten Son.

> John 1:14: “And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth. ”

<!-- -->   

> John 10:30: “I and my Father are one. ”

<!-- -->   

> Romans 4:11: “And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of faith which he had yet being uncircumcised: that he might be the Father of all them that believe though they be not circumcised; that righteousness may be imputed unto them also. ”

#### 2.3 The Son, Jesus Christ

We believe in the absolute Deity of Jesus Christ, His incarnation by means of Holy Spirit begattal and virgin birth, (born of Mary, a virgin, as no other man was ever born or can ever be born of woman, and that He is both the Son of God, and God the Son), His sinless life and miraculous ministry on earth, His death on the cross as a substitutionary atonement for the sins of all men, His bodily resurrection from among the dead, His exaltation to the right hand of the Majesty on high as Lord, Mediator, Priest, and Advocate, and His personal, pre-millennial, pre-tribulational, and imminent return to bring into consummation His work of redemption by ultimate triumph over Satan and his hosts.

> Isaiah 7:14: “Therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign; Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel. ”

<!-- -->   

> Matthew 1:18-25: “Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise: When as his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph, before they came together, she was found with child of the Holy Ghost. Then her husband, being a just man, and not willing to make her a public example, was minded to put her away privily. But while he thought on these things, behold, the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream, saying, Joseph, thou son of David, fear not to take thee Mary thy wife; for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost. And she shall bring forth a son; thou shalt call his name Jesus: for he shall save his people from their sins. Now all this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophets, saying, Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son and they shall call his name Immanuel, which being interpreted is, God with us. Then Joseph being raised from sleep did as the angel of the Lord has bidden him, and took unto him his wife: And knew her not till she had brought forth her firstborn son: and he called his name JESUS. ”

<!-- -->   

> John 11:25: “Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live. ”

<!-- -->  

> John 10:36: “Say ye of him, whom the Father hath sanctified and sent into the world, Thou blasphemest; because I said, I am the Son of God?”

<!-- -->  

> I Thessalonians. 5:9: “For God hath not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain Salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ. ”

#### 2.4 The Holy Spirit

We believe in the personality and Deity of the Holy Spirit, that it is by His energy that sinners are brought under conviction of sin and are drawn to Christ for salvation, that through His men are regenerated and sanctified that by Him the saints are indwelt with the divine presence and that by His endowment and enduement, God’s people are enabled to serve the Lord acceptably. We believe that He is the Divine Witness, Seal, Earnest, Anointing, Guide, Teacher, and Administrator.

> John 14:16-17:“And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you forever; Even the Spirit of truth; whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth him not, neither knoweth him; for he dwelleth with you, and shall be in you. ”

<!-- -->   

> John 16:18-11:“And when he is come, he will reprove the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgement: Of sin, because they believe not on me; Of righteousness, because I go to my Father, and ye see me no more; Of judgement, because the prince of this world is judged. ”

### 3. Creation

We believe in the Genesis account of creation, and that it is to be accepted literally, and not allegorically or figuratively that man was created directly in God’s own image and after His own likeness; that man’s creation was not a matter of evolution or evolutionary change of species or development through interminable periods of time from lower to higher forms; that all animal and vegetable life was made directly and God’s established law was they should bring forth only “after their kind. ”

> Genesis 1:1:“In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth. ”

<!-- -->   

> John 1:3:“All things were made by him; and without him was not anything made that was made. ”

### 4. Of the Devil, or Satan

We believe in the personality of Satan and that he was once holy, and enjoyed heavenly honours; but through pride and ambition to be as the Almighty, fell and drew after him a host of angels; that he is now the malignant prince of the power of the air, and the unholy god of this world. We hold him to be man’s great tempter, the enemy of God and His Christ, the accuser of the saints, the author of all the power of darkness. destined, however, to final defeat at the hands of God’s own Son, and to the judgement of an eternal justice in hell, a place prepared for him and his angels.

> Isaiah 14:12-15:“How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the Morning! How art thou cut down to the ground, which didst weaken the nations! For thou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God: I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation, in the sides of the north: I will ascend above the heights of the cloud; I will be like the most High. Yet thou shalt be brought down to hell, to the sides of the pit. ”

<!-- -->   

> Ezekiel 28:14-17:“Thou art the anointed cherub that covereth; and I have set thee so: thou wast upon the holy mountain of God: thou hast walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire. Thou wast perfect in thy ways from the day that thou wast created, till iniquity was found in thee. By the multitude of thy merchandise they have filled the midst of thee with violence and thou hast sinned: therefore I will cast thee as profane out of the mountain of God: and I will destroy thee, O covering cherub, from the midst of stones of fire. Thine heart was lifted up because of thy beauty, thou hast corrupted thy wisdom by reason of they brightness: I will cast thee to the ground, I will lay thee before kings, that they may behold thee. ”

### 5. Of the Fall of Man

We believe that man was created in innocence under the law of his Maker, but by voluntary transgression fell from his sinless and happy state, in consequence of which, all mankind are now sinners, not by compulsion, but of choice; and therefore under condemnation without defence or excuse.

> Genesis 3:1-6:“Now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden? And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the trees of the garden: But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die. And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die: For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be gods, knowing good and evil. And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat. ”

<!-- -->   

> Romans 3:10-19: As it is written, “There is none righteous, no, not one: There is none that understandeth, there is none that seeketh after God. They are all gone out of the way, they are together become unprofitable; there is none that doeth good, no not one. Their throat is an open sepulchre; with their tongues they have used deceit; the poison of asps is under their lips: Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness: Their feet are swift to shed blood: Destruction and misery are in their ways: And the way of peace have they not known: There is no fear of God before their eyes. Now we know that what things soever the law saith, it saith to them, who are under the law: that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may be guilty before God. ”

### 6. Of The Atonement For Sin

We believe that the salvation of sinners is wholly of grace through the mediatorial offices of the Son of God, who, by appointment of the Father, freely took upon Him our nature, yet without sin, honoured the divine law by His personal obedience, and,by His death made a full and vicarious atonement for our sins; that His atonement consisted not in setting us an example by His death as a martyr, but was the voluntary substitution of Himself in the sinner’s place, the just dying for the unjust. Christ, the Lord, bearing our sins in His own body on the tree, that, having risen from the dead, He is now enthroned in heaven and uniting in His wonderful person the tenderest sympathies with divine perfection, He is every way qualified to be a suitable, a compassionate and all-sufficient Saviour.

> Ephesians 2:8-9:“For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast. ”

<!-- -->   

> I Corinthians 15:3-4:“For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for all our sins according to the scriptures; And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures. ”

### 7. Repentance and Faith

We believe that repentance and faith are solemn obligations, and also inseparable graces, wrought in our souls by the quickening Spirit of God; thereby, being deeply convicted of our guilt, danger, and helplessness, and of the way of salvation by Christ, we turn to God with unfeigned contrition, confession and supplication for mercy; at the same time, heartily receiving the Lord Jesus Christ and openly confessing Him as our only and all-sufficient Saviour.

> Acts 20:21 :“Testifying both to the Jews, and also to the Greeks, repentance toward God, and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ. ”

<!-- -->   

> Luke 10:13:“Woe unto thee, Chorazini. Woe unto thee, Bethsaida! for if the mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon, which have been done in you, they had a great while ago repented, sitting in sack cloth and ashes. ”

<!-- -->   

> Romans 10:9-11:“That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead; thou shalt be saved. For with the heart. man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. For the scripture saith, Whosoever believeth on Him shall not be ashamed. ”

### 8. Of Grace In The New Creation

We believe that, in order to be saved, sinners must be born again; that the new birth is a new creation in Christ Jesus; that it is instantaneous and not a process; that in the new birth, the one dead in trespasses and in sins is made a partaker of the divine nature and receives eternal life, the free gift of God; that the new creation is brought about in the manner above our comprehension, not by culture, not by character, nor by the will of man, but wholly and solely by power of the Holy Spirit in connection with divine truth, so as to secure our voluntary obedience to the gospel; that its proper evidence appears in the Holy fruits of repentance and faith and newness of life.

> John 3:3:“Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the Kingdom of God. ”

<!-- -->   

> Ephesians 2:1:“And you hath he quickened who were dead in trespasses and sins. ”

<!-- -->   

> II Corinthians 5:17:“Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new. ”

### 9. Of Justification

We believe that the great gospel blessing which Christ secures to such as believe Him is justification; that justification includes the pardon of sin, and gift of eternal life on principles of righteousness; that it is bestowed, not in consideration of any works of righteousness which we have done; but solely through faith in the Redeemer’s blood, His righteousness is imputed unto us. ”

> Acts 13:39:“And by him all that believe are justified from all things, from which ye could not be justified by the law of Moses. ”

<!-- -->   

> Romans 8:1:“There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh but after the Spirit. ”

<!-- -->   

> Titus 3:5-8:“Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost; which he shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Saviour; That being justified by his grace; we should be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life. This is a beautiful saying, and these things I will that thou affirm constantly, that they which have believed in God might be careful to maintain good works. These things are good and profitable unto men. ”

### 10. Of the Freeness of Salvation

We believe in God’s electing grace; that the blessings of salvation are made free to all who believe by the gospel; that it is the immediate duty of all to accept them by a cordial, penitent and obedient faith; and nothing prevents the salvation of the greatest sinner on earth but his own inherent depravity and voluntary rejection of the gospel; which rejection involves him in an aggravated condemnation.  

> I Thessalonians 1:4:“Knowing, brethren beloved, your election of God. ”

<!-- -->   

> Colossians 3:12-13:“Put on therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels of mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, longsuffering; forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, if any man have a quarrel against any: even as Christ forgave you, so also do ye. ”

### 11. Of Sanctification

We believe sanctification is in three tenses: every saved person has been sanctified through the death of Christ, is being sanctified by the Holy Spirit, and will be sanctified completely when he goes to be with Christ. Every believer has two natures, an old and a new, and the old cannot be eradicated during this life.  

> Hebrews 10:10:“By the which we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all. ”

<!-- -->   

> John 17:17:“Sanctify them through thy truth: thy Word is truth. ”

<!-- -->   

> Ephesians 5:22-27:“Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the Church, not having spot or wrinkle, or any such thing, but that it should be holy and without blemish. ”

### 12. Of the Church

We believe in the Universal Church. a living, spiritual body of which Christ is the head and of which all regenerate people are members and that is was purchased with the blood of Christ, the Rock, that its mission is to bear to the ends of the earth a spirit-filled testimony to the judgement of God against sin and salvation of sinners who repent towards God and exercise faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. We believe that a local New Testament church is a body of believers in Christ. having followed the Lord through the waters of baptism, associated together under direction and government of the Holy Spirit for worship, instruction, fellowship, service, and the spread of the gospel to the uttermost part of the earth; that is absolutely sovereign, under the administration of the Holy Spirit, in the handling of its own affairs and in determining its own relationship; that its relationship with other ecclesiastical bodies is one of fellowship only.

> Matthew 16:17-18:“And Jesus answered and said unto him, Blessed art thou, Simon Barjona; for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven. And I say unto Thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my Church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it. ”

<!-- -->   

> Acts 20:28:“Take heed therefore unto yourselves, and to all the flock, over the which the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers, to feed the church of God, which He hath purchased with his own blood. ”

<!-- -->   

> Colossians 1:18:“And He is the head of the body, the Church: who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all things He might have the preeminence. ”

### 13. Of Separation

We believe that the Local Church is to separate itself, organically and inorganically, in fellowship and doctrine, from any and all organisations and individuals that are engaged in action and practice, by method or by teaching, in any activity or doctrine that is contrary to the plain teaching of the Word of God. This includes the entire antiChrist ecumenical movement as well as all of its components: neo-evangelicalism, neo-orthodoxy, liberalism, and any such groups or individuals. It also includes these that disgrace the cause of our Lord by improper and uncomely conduct in the practice of their religion. Anything that is not scriptural is not spiritual. We believe in the separation of believers unto Christ and from the world so as to maintain good works and to have no fellowship with the evil works of darkness but rather reprove them. We therefore urge upon every member to abstain from every questionable thing, keeping himself (or herself) from “every appearance of evil in religion, dress, conversation, amusement, business, habit, etc, according to the teachings of God’s Holy Word.

> Ephesians. 5:11:“And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove them. ”

<!-- -->   

> Romans. 16:17:“Now I beseech you, brethren, mark them which cause divisions and offences contrary to the doctrine which ye have learned; and avoid them. ”

<!-- -->   

> Romans. 12:1-2:“I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service. And be not conformed to this world, but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God. ”

### 14. Of Baptism

We believe that Christian Baptism is the immersion of believer in water into the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit; that it sets forth in picture the essential facts in the experience of the believer. death to sin and resurrection to walk in newness of life, and the essential facts in the hope of the believer. that should he experience physical death, he will be raised from the dead to participate in the eternal glory of our Lord and Saviour, Jesus Christ.

> Romans 6:4:“Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in the newness of life. ”

<!-- -->   

> Acts 8:36-38:“And as they went on their way, they came unto a certain water: and the eunuch said, See, here is water; what doth hinder me to be baptised? And Philip said, If thou believest with all thine heart, thou mayest. And he answered and said, I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God. And he commanded the chariot to stand still: and they went down both into the water, both Philip and the eunuch; and he baptised him. ”

### 15. Of the Lord’s Supper

We believe that the Lord’s supper is a commemoration of the Lord’s death to be observed till He comes, that the elements. the bread and the fruit of the vine. are only symbols of His broken body and shed blood, and that our observances of it is a pictorial testimony of the believers’ fellowship with the crucified and should be preceded by solemn heart-searching and self-judgement.

> I Corinthians. 11:23-30:“For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, That the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread: And when he had given thanks, he brake it, and said, Take, eat: this is my body, which is broken for you: this do in remembrance of me. After the same manner also he took the cup, when he supped, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood: this do ye, as oft as ye drink it, in remembrance of me. For as often as ye eat this bread and drink this cup, ye do show the Lord’s death till he come. Wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord, unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord. But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of that bread, and drink of that cup. For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily,eateth and drinketh damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord’s body. For this cause many are weak and sickly among you, and many sleep. ”

### 16. Of the Security of the Saints

We believe that all who are truly born are sealed by the Holy Ghost and are kept by God the Father for Jesus Christ. We believe that it is the privilege of believers to rejoice in the assurance of their salvation through the testimony of God’s Word which, however, clearly forbids the use of Christian liberty as an occasion to the flesh.

> John 10:28, 29: “And I give unto them eternal life, and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand. My Father which gave them me, is greater than all; and no man is able to pluck them out of my Father’s hand. ”

<!-- -->   

> Titus 2:11-15: “For the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men, Teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly in this present world; looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and Saviour Jesus Christ, who gave himself for us that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works. These things speak and exhort, and rebuke with all authority. Let no man despise thee. ”

### 17. Of the Righteous and the Wicked

We believe that there is a radical and essential difference between the righteous and the wicked; that such only through faith are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, and sanctified by the Spirit of our God, are truly righteous in His esteem; while all such as continue in impenitence and unbelief are in His sight wicked, and under the curse; and this distinction holds among men both in and after death, in the everlasting felicity of the saved and the everlasting conscious suffering of the lost.

> I John 5:19: “And we know that we are of God, and the whole world lieth in wickedness. ”

<!-- -->   

> Proverbs 14:32: “The wicked is driven away in his wickedness: but the righteous hath hope in his death. ”

### 18. Of Civil Government

We believe that the government authority is ordained of God for the good of the citizens under its jurisdiction, that believers in Christ are to be the most ardent to obey its every ordinance for the Lord’s sake, and that we are to faithfully pray for those who occupy positions of civil authority. We believe, however, in the absolute separation of church and state, that each has been ordained of God to render services in entirely difference spheres and for different purposes, and therefore neither is to dictate to the other, nor are they to form any organic union whatsoever.

> Romans 13:7: “Render therefore to all their dues: tribute to whom tribute is due; custom to whom custom; fear to whom fear; honour to whom honour. ”

<!-- -->   

> I Timothy 2:1-6: “I exhort therefore, that first of all, supplications, prayers, intercessions and giving of thanks, be made for all men; For kings and for all that are in authority; that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty. For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour; who will have all men to be saved and come unto the knowledge of the truth. For there is one God and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus: who gave himself for all, to be testified in due time. ”

### 19. Of the Resurrecting and Return of Christ

We believe in and accept the sacred Scriptures upon these subjects at their face and full value. Of the Resurrection, we believe that Christ rose bodily “The third day according to the Scriptures,” that He ascended “to the right hand of the throne of God;” that He alone is our “merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God;” “That this same Jesus which is taken up from you into heaven shall so come in like manner as ye have seen Him go into heaven” bodily, personally, and visibly; that the “dead in Christ shall rise first,” that the living saints “shall be changed in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump;” “That the Lord God shall give unto Him the throne of His Father David,” and that “Christ shall reign a thousand years in righteousness until He hath put all enemies under His feet. ”

> I Corinthians. 15:3-7: “For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures: And that he was seen of Cephas, then of the twelve: After that, he was seen of above five hundred brethren at once; of whom the greater part remain unto the present, but some are asleep. After that, he was seen of James, then of all the apostles. ”

<!-- -->   

> I Thessalonians. 4:16-18: “For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God, and the dead in Christ shall rise first: Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the Lord. Wherefore comfort one another with these words. ”

### 20. Of Missions

We believe in our Lord’s divinely given commission; and because we do, it is our belief that the church has a divine imperative to actively participate in and contribute toward missionary endeavours at home and abroad. It is not only the duty of the missionaries supported by the church to carry the gospel message to the lost, but we believe it is the duty of every member to give the Gospel message to others on every occasion that opportunity affords.  

> Luke 24:4-7: “And that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem. ”

<!-- -->   

> Matthew. 28:18-20: “And Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth. Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost; Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you and lo, I am with you always, even unto the end of the world. Amen. ”
