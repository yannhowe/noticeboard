<p><em>This is our philosophy of ministry. To read about the scriptural basis for our belief instead, go <a href="/our-beliefs/">here</a></em></p>

<h2 id="our-core-values">Our Core Values</h2>

<ul>
<li>We believe that the Bible is God’s Word to His people and is the only foundation for our faith and practice.</li>
<li>We believe that worship is the duty of all man.</li>
<li>We believe that a church is built on strong families and marriages. We strive to excellence in our youth and children’s programs.</li>
<li>We believe that evangelism is a natural response to God’s love.</li>
<li>Every Christian is a minister of Christ with spiritual gifts for service.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="our-mission">Our Mission</h2>

<h3 id="exalt-our-lord">Exalt our Lord</h3>

<p>Through God-centered worship.</p>

<p>Exalting the supremacy of God is the ultimate purpose of our existence as a Church. God’s glory is our highest passion and motivation as a body of believers. We believe that Jesus Christ is to have preeminence in all things, which includes the activities of the Church.</p>

<p>Worship is the act of reverence. We revere God alone and center all on His being. Our lives are to be a living example of God-centeredness. Everything we do must constantly seek honor the God we serve and not be just Sunday worship.</p>

<h3 id="edify-and-equip-believers">Edify and Equip believers</h3>

<p><strong>Towards Christ-likeness through steadfast fellowship and consistent communication of Biblical truth.</strong></p>

<p>Teaching and instructing the members of the church to be effective in their individual ministries in the church. This church seeks to be a place where its members are nurtured to becoming mature ministers in God’s kingdom.</p>

<p><strong>Towards Christ-likeness</strong></p>

<p>Jesus Christ is God incarnate, the perfect Son of God. All our lives must be sanctified continually to become more like Him in every possible way.</p>

<p><strong>Through steadfast fellowship</strong></p>

<p>the New Testament church was instructed to be part of a local assembly and we believe that this is essential to the spiritual growth of all believers.</p>

<p><strong>By communicating Biblical truth</strong></p>

<p>The vocational ministers here are dedicated to teaching and preaching the whole counsel of God’s truth effectively.</p>

<h3 id="evangelize-the-lost-through-prayer-and-constant-outreach">Evangelize the lost through prayer and constant outreach.</h3>

<p>A natural response to exalting God and the edification of believer is the evangelism of the lost. We believe that when people are enthusiastic about the growth and change that God is producing in their lives, they will be excited to share the good news with neighbours, co-workers, friends and family.</p>

<p><strong>Through prayer</strong></p>

<p>Prayer is the foundation to every Christian’s life, especially in witnessing to unbelievers. We must go out to evangelize the lost having sought God’s power through prayer.</p>

<p><strong>Constant outreach</strong></p>

<p>We believe that evangelism is not a special meeting that we hold once every quarter but a constant living out of our faith. It is living constantly in a way that personal testimonies are so dynamic that faith is contagious and caught because of individual and corporate lifestyles.</p>

<h3 id="empowered-of-the-holy-spirit">Empowered of the Holy Spirit.</h3>

<p>We believe that the Holy Spirit is the Christians’ aid in time past and today. In order to exalt God, edify believers, and evangelize the lost effectively, we must learn to depend on the power of the Holy Spirit and not our own strength. The Holy Spirit is the part of the Godhead given to us to do His work.</p>

<h2 id="our-vision">Our Vision</h2>

<p>The vision of Grace Baptist Ministries is to glorify God by building a New Testament Church to develop genuine Christians in order to fulfill the Great Commission in Singapore, Asia and the rest of the world.</p>

<p><strong>Our vision is to glorify God</strong></p>

<p>God created us to glorify Him. Glory is defined as the honourable representation of God. &ldquo;God created man in His own image..&rdquo; (Gen 1:26) and our duty as His creation is to &ldquo;..do all to the glory of God.&rdquo; (1 Cor 10:31)</p>

<p><strong>By building a New Testament Church</strong></p>

<p>We believe that God&rsquo;s primary means of working in this Dispensation is the local church. The local body of believers is where God&rsquo;s love, mercy, grace, forgiveness, help, conviction, etc., is demonstrated. The local church is God&rsquo;s light in the dark world we live in today.</p>

<p><strong>To develop genuine Christians</strong></p>

<p>The purpose of the Church is to equip its members to live a life that is upheld by the principles that are laid down in Bible. Members will be equipped to be ministers to those in and outside of the body of Christ. God&rsquo;s work is not dedicated solely to the full-time pastoral and ministerial staff but to all believers, that they might all do the work of the ministry.</p>

<p><strong>In order to fulfill the Great Commission</strong></p>

<p>The Great Commission is God&rsquo;s command to His Church. We as believers in Christ and ministers of the Church are to reproduce ourselves in every generation. This involves winning, teaching, mentoring, encouraging, rebuking, and loving every member to the point where they reproduce themselves in the life of another.</p>

<p><strong>In Singapore</strong></p>

<p>Singapore is a country that promotes the tolerance of different religions. Religious tolerance and the lack of persecution drives us to evangelize the lost in the streets and neighbourhoods around us.</p>

<p><strong>In Asia</strong></p>

<p>Singapore is located strategically in Asia and acts as a gateway to many Southeast Asian countries. We want to aid missionaries by providing them a base of operations where they can move into and out of Asia to do the work of God.</p>

<p><strong>The rest of the world</strong></p>

<p>In addition to providing a base of missions, we want to aid missionaries in all parts of the world. By committing to missions givings and the raising of missionaries, we endeavour to expand God&rsquo;s kingdom to all parts of the world.</p>
